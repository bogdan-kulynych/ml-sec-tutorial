# Exercise on adversarial examples

## What is here?
There are two tracks. Follow the instructions in [`adversarial_examples.ipynb`](adversarial_examples.ipynb) notebook to implement
attacks on your own. Use [`adversarial_examples_solved.ipynb`](adversarial_examples_solved.ipynb) if you do not want to implement the
attacks, but you just want to play around.

## Running
Installation and start if using default Python virtualization:

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    jupyter notebook
