# Exercise on adversarial examples

## Setup
If you are using the default Python virtualization, first you want to initialize a virtual
environment and install all the needed packages:

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, you need to run Jupyter:

    jupyter notebook

## What is here?
There are two tracks to this exercise. Follow the instructions in
[`adversarial_examples.ipynb`](adversarial_examples.ipynb) notebook to implement adversarial-example
attacks on your own. Use [`adversarial_examples_solved.ipynb`](adversarial_examples_solved.ipynb) if
you do not want to implement the attacks, but you just want to play around.
